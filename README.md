# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly) and provides metrics on how many times the shortened URLs were visited.

This web app securely manages user sessions with the cookie-session and bcryptjs packages and utilizes EJS as the template view engine.
